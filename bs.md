# Brain storming

- what do i want the frontend to be able to do?
  - call endpoint easily with modules, something like this
    - `sdk.modules.orders.[available-functions]({[parameters]})`
    - he should be able to paginate data
    - include nested entities
    - filter data by various operators
    - sort data by eligible fields
    - order data by eligible fields
    - group by maybe?
    - i should use the typeorm object mapper for now, create sdk based on it.
